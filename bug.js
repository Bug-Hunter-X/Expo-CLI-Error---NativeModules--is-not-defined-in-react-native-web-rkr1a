This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` library within a project that's not configured correctly for web support.  It often manifests when attempting to import or use modules that are not compatible with the web environment.  The specific error message might point to a module that relies on native modules not available in the browser.

```javascript
// Example code snippet where the error might occur
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const nativeModule = NativeModules.SomeNativeModule;
// ... use nativeModule ...
```
